            Hi! I am Nichol John L. Valmoria, an aspiring author writing stories in the internet and currently studying at the University of Bohol in Tagbilaran.
            I'm 21 years old and barely awake most of the time, mainly because I spend most of my time in the evening writing.
            There's nothing else, really, other than the fact that I'm incredibly lazy and constantly tired.

        <p class="red">
            I love writing and I'm obsessed with it, though I'm not entirely good with it.
            This started as a hobby but the more and more I read others' works, the more I got into it.
            I dream to have my own light novel be animated for the big screen.
        </p>

        <p class="yellow">
            My plan to future is to simply write.
            Write until I no longer can't.
            I only want to write stories and nothing else.
